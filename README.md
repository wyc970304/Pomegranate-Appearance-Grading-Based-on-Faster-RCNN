**Readme** for this project:

There are 2 main folders (or compressed files for backup) for this project. They are:

1. mmdetection-master
This is the work folder of the 'Pomegranate Appearance Quality Recognition System' in this project based on MMDetection. It has main parts includes:

(a) GUI.py----The executable file (i.e. system GUI) of this system. To run this file normally, the environment which supports MMDetection-master must be configured. Before running, check if the paths of work configuration files in run() is correct for your PC. 

(b) data/fruits/images----The Pomegranate image dataset for training & testing. 
In path data/fruits, the folder test1_label & train1_label includes the .xml annotations for the dataset. The file train.json & test.json are the coco format annotations converted by xml2coco.py. For mmdetection, we actually use the coco format annotations.

(c) work_dirs/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco/epoch_12.pth----The model embedded in system (i.e. faster rcnn+ResNet50+FPN) in our project. 

(d) configs/faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py----The configuration file for system model training & detection. If the system cannot work normally, check in this file about the configuration paths of each work files in your PC.

Noticed that: For all codes in 'mmdetection-master' should be run in the correct environment which supports mmdetection-master. The guideline of configure the environment can be seen in: 
https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection 
(Noticed that it must be the environment of 'master' branch/version of mmdetection.)




2. compare
This is the work folder of codes for training & performance testing of two comparison models (i.e. faster rcnn+ResNet50 & faster rcnn+VGG16) in this project developed based on lab source codes. It has main parts includes:

(a) folder 'logs_vgg' & 'logs_resnet'----The output path of saving trained comparison models.
There are 2 completed comparison models in these 2 folders separately already, which are:
VGG16: Epoch85-Total_Loss0.3951-Val_Loss0.3538.pth
ResNet50: Epoch85-Total_Loss0.1797-Val_Loss0.1788.pth

(b) folder 'accuracy'----Includes main codes for testing model performance, performance outputs also generates in 'output' in this path.

(c) folder 'RESULTS_examples'----Includes 2 examples of testing performance output of comparison model which we trained in the project.


To build (i.e. train) and test a comparison model, try to follow this general folow:
(Enrironment: torch >= 1.2.0)

Training the model:
1. Set path of Pomegranate image dataset in data_config.py
(*We have use data/fruits/images folder in 'mmdetection-master' as the path of Pomegranate image dataset.)
2. Set corresponding classes in data_process/data_annotation.py----using .xml annotations to generate .txt annotations
(*We have use data/fruits/test1_label & data/fruits/train1_label folders in 'mmdetection-master' as the path of .xml annotations.)
3. Set the classes you use in model_data/voc_classes.txt (i.e. G1,G2,G3)
4. Sey NUM_CLASSES in train.py to the number of positive classes (i.e. 3 grades)
5. Set 'Configuration of training' in train.py
6. Run train.py to start training a VGG/ResNet50 model

Testing the performance of a choosed modelï¼š
1. Set configuration of the test (e.g. model path, category of model, confidence...) in frcnn.py
2. Run accuracy/get_ground_true.py----get the ground truth
3. Run accuracy/predict_all_for_calculate.py---get the detection result
4. Run accuracy/main.py----get PR curve, AP & mAP and other performance outputs, saves in 'accuracy/output' folder.
